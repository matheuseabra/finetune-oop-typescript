# FineTune OOP Typescript ðŸš€

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wswebcreation/protractor-cucumber-typescript-boilerplate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wswebcreation/protractor-cucumber-typescript-boilerplate)

Project built for the FineTune Selection, demonstrating how to structure OOP concepts with TypeScript, writing tests using Protactor as testing library along with CucumberJS and Gherkin language.

## Features

* working configuration out of the box for **CucumberJS 3.x**
* feature and step-files
* no need to compile TypeScript testfiles before running
* automatically making screenshots on failed steps (you can adjust the filename to whatever you want, it's just a simple setup)

## Quickstart

```sh
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone

# 2. Navigate to the project root directory
npm install

# 3. Run tests
npm run e2e // Run all the available featurefiles
npm run e2e -- --feature= example // Run a specific tagged test(s) / featurefile(s)
```

## CucumberJS compiles on-the-fly
With the provided setup in the [`protractor.shared.conf.js`](/e2e-tests/config/protractor.shared.conf.js) you don't need to compile the TypeScript files before you run them. It will be done automatically for you with the `compiler` in the `cucumberOpts`.

```
cucumberOpts: {
	compiler: "ts:ts-node/register",
	require: [..],
	format: 'pretty',
	tags: ''
}
```
